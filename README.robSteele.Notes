Briefly I used Joseph Wang's build.sh file to create a bin.linux64 directory
that included a libVO.a file. I copied this directory to
iraf-v216/perserve-bin.linux64

I modified bin/mksysgen to copy the libVO.a file from this directory to
bin.linux64 after the mkclean step.

Then the build resulted in a cl.e and ecl.e in bin.linux64 that I could
execute.

From this experiment it seems pretty clear that creating a libVO.a is
critical to getting a working build.
