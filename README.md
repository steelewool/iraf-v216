GOTCHAS

The big gotcha is that IRAF does it's own dynamic memory allocation so
that there is some very strange pointer magic in orde

There is a lot of pointer magic here.  For example there is a patch

    force iraf to align on 128-bit boundaries

    This is necessary for GCC 4.8 to properly generate SSE2 double
        word aligned move instructions.  See

    https://bugs.mageia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=11507

    for discussion of this issue.

----------

Also the c code that is generated by f2c is modified in order to make
the pointers match up.  Unfortunately I fixed it two years ago and
forgot what the problem was, but it had something to do with the size
of doubles generated by f2c

FORTRAN 95 conversion

Would really like to upgrade IRAF to be able to use fortran95.
However, there is a problem.  IRAF does its only memory allocation and
uses a fortran 77 equivalence statement to locate the base of the
dynamic member and this does not work for fortran 95.
